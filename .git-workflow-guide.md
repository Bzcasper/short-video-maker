# Git Workflow Guide - Private Development Setup

## Current Configuration âœ…

Your repository is now configured for private development on the `bobby` branch while maintaining the ability to pull from the official repo.

### Remote Configuration:
- **origin** (your fork): `https://github.com/Bzcasper/short-video-maker.git`
  - âœ… Can fetch and push
  - ðŸ”’ Your private commits go here
  
- **upstream** (official repo): `https://github.com/gyoridavid/short-video-maker.git`
  - âœ… Can fetch latest changes
  - ðŸš« Cannot push (disabled for privacy)

## Workflow Commands

### 1. Daily Development (Private Work)
```bash
# Work on bobby branch (your private branch)
git checkout bobby

# Make your changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Your private changes"

# Push to YOUR fork only (not visible to official repo)
git push origin bobby
```

### 2. Sync with Official Repo Updates
```bash
# Fetch latest changes from official repo
git fetch upstream

# Switch to main and update
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Merge latest changes into your bobby branch
git checkout bobby
git merge main

# Push updated bobby branch to your fork
git push origin bobby
```

### 3. Emergency: If You Accidentally Push to Wrong Remote
```bash
# This will fail safely now:
git push upstream bobby
# Result: "fatal: unable to access 'no_push': URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL"
```

## Branch Strategy

### ðŸ”’ Private Development
- **bobby branch**: Your private development work
- **origin/bobby**: Pushed to your fork only
- **Visibility**: Only you can see these commits

### ðŸ”„ Official Updates  
- **main branch**: Tracks official repo
- **upstream/main**: Official repository main branch
- **Sync Strategy**: Pull from upstream, merge to bobby

## Safety Measures Implemented

1. **Upstream Push Disabled**: Cannot accidentally push to official repo
2. **Default Push Current**: Only pushes current branch by default
3. **Clear Remote Separation**: Different remotes for private vs official code

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Check which remote you're pushing to
git remote -v

# Check current branch
git branch

# Safe daily workflow
git add . && git commit -m "feat: your changes" && git push origin bobby

# Weekly sync with official repo
git fetch upstream && git checkout main && git pull upstream main && git checkout bobby && git merge main && git push origin bobby
```

## Status: âœ… CONFIGURED
Your bobby branch commits are now private to your fork and won't be visible to the official repository.
