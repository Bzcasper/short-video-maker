# Short Video Maker: Comprehensive Enhancement Roadmap & Prioritization

## Executive Summary

This roadmap transforms Short Video Maker from a solid video generation tool into a comprehensive, AI-driven content automation platform. Based on extensive technical analysis, market research, and architectural planning, we recommend starting with API layer enhancements followed by core video features, as this approach maximizes scalability and enables concurrent development streams.

## Impact-Effort Prioritization Matrix

| Enhancement             | Impact Score | Effort Score | Priority | Rationale                                      |
|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| REST/GraphQL API Layer  | 9.5          | 3.0          | HIGH     | Enables all integrations, low complexity        |
| Queue System (BullMQ)   | 9.0          | 2.5          | HIGH     | Critical for scaling, leverages existing patterns |
| Multi-Provider TTS      | 8.5          | 4.0          | HIGH     | High user value, manageable complexity         |
| AI Script Generation    | 9.5          | 5.0          | HIGH     | Massive user value, moderate complexity        |
| Webhook System          | 8.0          | 2.0          | HIGH     | Essential for automation, simple implementation|
| Asset Upload/Management | 7.5          | 3.5          | MEDIUM   | Good user value, moderate effort               |
| Advanced Subtitles      | 7.0          | 4.5          | MEDIUM   | Nice-to-have, significant effort               |
