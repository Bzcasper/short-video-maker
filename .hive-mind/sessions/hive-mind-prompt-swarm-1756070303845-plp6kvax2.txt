HIVE MIND CONFIGURATION:
📌 Swarm ID: swarm-1756070303845-plp6kvax2
📌 Swarm Name: hive-1756070303842
🎯 Objective: # Task: Design a Comprehensive Enhancement Roadmap & Prioritization for Short Video Maker

## 1. Role and Goal
You will act as a senior product‑technical architect specializing in AI‑driven video generation platforms, and your core objective is to deliver a detailed, prioritized enhancement plan that converts Short Video Maker into a full‑stack, scalable content automation engine. The plan must include concrete implementation steps, milestones, resource considerations, and a clear recommendation on whether to start with API layer improvements or core video feature upgrades.

## 2. Background and Context
Short Video Maker presently provides a solid video generation stack (text‑to‑speech, captions, stock clips, rendering). The desired expansions are:

- **Core video features:** Multi‑voice TTS (ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS, Azure TTS), custom background assets (user uploads, Unsplash/Pixabay), advanced subtitle styling (fonts, colors, karaoke highlighting).  
- **API layer:** REST + GraphQL endpoints, webhook callbacks on render completion, bulk job submission.  
- **Workflow automation:** n8n integration, queue system (BullMQ/Redis) for parallel rendering.  
- **AI enhancements:** Automated script generation (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Claude), SEO metadata creation, AI‑generated thumbnails (Stable Diffusion/DALL·E).  
- **Deployment & scaling:** Docker Compose with GPU support, horizontal worker scaling, persistent storage on S3/MinIO/DigitalOcean Spaces, multi‑cloud deployment options.  

The end‑to‑end flow should enable: topic → AI script → video generation → SEO metadata → thumbnail → automated upload to YouTube Shorts/TikTok via n8n, with final assets stored for reuse.

## 3. Key Steps
1. **Requirement Clarification & Scope Definition**  
   - Gather stakeholder priorities, target user personas, and performance SLAs.  
   - Identify dependencies between API enhancements and core video features.  

2. **Prioritization Matrix Construction**  
   - Create a 2 × 2 impact‑effort matrix (Impact: user value, Revenue, Scalability; Effort: development time, complexity).  
   - Populate with all listed enhancements and score them to determine the optimal start point.  

3. **API Layer Enhancement Plan**  
   - Design REST and GraphQL schemas (endpoints for script submission, status polling, batch jobs).  
   - Define webhook payload format and authentication mechanism.  
   - Sketch batch processing workflow and rate‑limiting strategy.  

4. **Core Video Feature Upgrade Plan**  
   - Architecture for pluggable TTS providers with fallback logic.  
   - Media asset ingestion module (user upload, Unsplash/Pixabay API integration).  
   - Subtitle engine extension for styling and karaoke effects.  

5. **Workflow Automation Blueprint**  
   - n8n workflow diagram: trend extraction → script generation → Short Video Maker API call → metadata generation → upload nodes.  
   - Queue system selection (BullMQ vs Redis Streams) and job lifecycle management.  

6. **AI Component Integration**  
   - Select language model(s) for script generation; define prompt templates.  
   - Implement SEO metadata generator using LLMs; map outputs to platform fields.  
   - Integrate image generation model for thumbnails; set resolution and branding guidelines.  

7. **Deployment & Scaling Strategy**  
   - Docker Compose files with GPU‑enabled service definitions.  
   - Horizontal scaling plan: auto‑scale worker replicas based on queue depth.  
   - Persistent storage architecture: bucket policies, CDN caching, versioning.  

8. **Milestones & Deliverables**  
   - **M1 (2 weeks):** Prioritization matrix + decision recommendation.  
   - **M2 (4 weeks):** API layer prototype (REST, webhook, batch).  
   - **M3 (6 weeks):** Core video feature module (multi‑voice TTS, custom backgrounds).  
   - **M4 (8 weeks):** n8n workflow and queue system integration.  
   - **M5 (10 weeks):** AI script + SEO + thumbnail pipelines.  
   - **M6 (12 weeks):** Full deployment package with scaling docs.  

9. **Risk Assessment & Mitigation**  
   - Identify potential bottlenecks (GPU resource contention, third‑party API rate limits).  
   - Propose fallback mechanisms and monitoring alerts.  

## 4. Output Requirements
- **Format:** Markdown document with clear headings, tables for the prioritization matrix and milestone schedule, bullet lists for actions, and code blocks for any example schemas or Docker snippets.  
- **Style:** Professional, technical, concise, and action‑oriented.  
- **Constraints:**  
  - Include a definitive recommendation (API first vs video features first) based on the impact‑effort analysis.  
  - All implementation steps must be actionable and include expected deliverables.  
  - The final output must contain only the roadmap document; no additional commentary or meta‑information.

   Step 2: REQUIRED - Spawn ACTUAL Agents with Claude Code's Task Tool (Single Message):
   [Claude Code Task Tool - CONCURRENT Agent Execution]:
      Task("Researcher Agent", "You are a researcher in the hive. Coordinate via hooks. - Conduct thorough research using WebSearch and WebFetch", "researcher")
   Task("Coder Agent", "You are a coder in the hive. Coordinate via hooks. - Write clean, maintainable, well-documented code", "coder")
   Task("Analyst Agent", "You are a analyst in the hive. Coordinate via hooks. - Analyze data patterns and trends", "analyst")
   Task("Tester Agent", "You are a tester in the hive. Coordinate via hooks. - Design comprehensive test strategies", "tester")
   
   Step 3: Batch ALL Todos Together (Single TodoWrite Call):
   TodoWrite { "todos": [
     { "id": "1", "content": "Initialize hive mind collective", "status": "in_progress", "priority": "high" },
     { "id": "2", "content": "Establish consensus protocols", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
     { "id": "3", "content": "Distribute initial tasks to workers", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
     { "id": "4", "content": "Set up collective memory", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
     { "id": "5", "content": "Monitor worker health", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium" },
     { "id": "6", "content": "Aggregate worker outputs", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium" },

     { "id": "8", "content": "Optimize performance", "status": "pending", "priority": "low" }
   ] }

2. **ESTABLISH COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE**:
   - Use consensus_vote for major decisions
   - Share all discoveries via memory_share
   - Synchronize learning with neural_sync
   - Coordinate strategy with swarm_think

3. **QUEEN LEADERSHIP PATTERNS**:
   
   - Focus on high-level planning and coordination
   - Delegate implementation details to workers
   - Monitor overall progress and adjust strategy
   - Make executive decisions when consensus fails
   
   

4. **WORKER COORDINATION**:
   - Spawn workers based on task requirements
   - Assign tasks according to worker specializations
   - Enable peer-to-peer communication for collaboration
   - Monitor and rebalance workloads as needed

5. **CONSENSUS MECHANISMS**:
   - Decisions require >50% worker agreement
   
   
   

6. **COLLECTIVE MEMORY**:
   - Store all important decisions in shared memory
   - Tag memories with worker IDs and timestamps
   - Use memory namespaces: hive/, queen/, workers/, tasks/
   - Implement memory consensus for critical data

7. **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**:
   - Monitor swarm metrics continuously
   - Identify and resolve bottlenecks
   - Train neural networks on successful patterns
   - Scale worker count based on workload

💡 HIVE MIND BEST PRACTICES:

✅ ALWAYS use BatchTool for parallel operations
✅ Store decisions in collective memory immediately
✅ Use consensus for critical path decisions
✅ Monitor worker health and reassign if needed
✅ Learn from failures and adapt strategies
✅ Maintain constant inter-agent communication
✅ Aggregate results before final delivery

❌ NEVER make unilateral decisions without consensus
❌ NEVER let workers operate in isolation
❌ NEVER ignore performance metrics
❌ NEVER skip memory synchronization
❌ NEVER abandon failing workers

1. Break down into major phases using swarm_think
2. Create specialized worker teams for each phase
3. Establish success criteria and checkpoints
4. Implement feedback loops and adaptation
5. Aggregate and synthesize all worker outputs
6. Deliver comprehensive solution with consensus

⚡ CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION WITH CLAUDE CODE'S TASK TOOL:

The Hive Mind MUST use Claude Code's Task tool for actual agent execution:

✅ CORRECT Pattern:
[Single Message - All Agents Spawned Concurrently]:
  Task("Researcher", "Research patterns and best practices...", "researcher")
  Task("Coder", "Implement core features...", "coder")
  Task("Tester", "Create comprehensive tests...", "tester")
  Task("Analyst", "Analyze performance metrics...", "analyst")
  TodoWrite { todos: [8-10 todos ALL in ONE call] }

❌ WRONG Pattern:
Message 1: Task("agent1", ...)
Message 2: Task("agent2", ...)
Message 3: TodoWrite { single todo }
// This breaks parallel coordination!

Remember:
- Use Claude Code's Task tool to spawn ALL agents in ONE message
- MCP tools are ONLY for coordination setup, not agent execution
- Batch ALL TodoWrite operations (5-10+ todos minimum)
- Execute ALL file operations concurrently
- Store multiple memories simultaneously

🚀 BEGIN HIVE MIND EXECUTION:

Initialize the swarm now with the configuration above. Use your collective intelligence to solve the objective efficiently. The Queen must coordinate, workers must collaborate, and the hive must think as one.

Remember: You are not just coordinating agents - you are orchestrating a collective intelligence that is greater than the sum of its parts.
